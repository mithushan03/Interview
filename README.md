## 📌 About the Project

**InterviewIQ** is an AI-powered interview preparation web application designed to help students, developers, and job seekers prepare for interviews more effectively.

Instead of manually searching for interview questions, users can generate role-based, topic-based, and difficulty-based questions using AI. The platform provides a clean dashboard where users can practice, improve confidence, and prepare for real-world technical and HR interviews.

This project is especially useful for:

- 🎓 Students preparing for internships
- 👨‍💻 Developers preparing for software engineering interviews
- 🤖 AI/ML learners preparing for technical interviews
- 🧑‍💼 Job seekers preparing for HR and behavioral interviews
- 📚 Anyone who wants structured interview practice

2. User registers or logs in
3. User enters the dashboard
4. User selects interview role, topic, or difficulty
5. Frontend sends request to backend API
6. Backend sends prompt to AI service
7. AI generates interview questions
8. Questions are returned to the frontend
9. User practices and improves interview preparation
```

---
